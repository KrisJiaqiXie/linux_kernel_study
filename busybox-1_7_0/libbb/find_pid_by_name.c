/*
In Linux we have three ways to determine "process name":
1. /proc/PID/stat has "...(name)...", among other things. It's so-called "comm" field.
2. /proc/PID/cmdline's first NUL-terminated string. It's argv[0] from exec syscall.
3. /proc/PID/exe symlink. Points to the running executable file.

kernel threads:
 comm: thread name
 cmdline: empty
 exe: <readlink fails>

executable
 comm: first 15 chars of base name
 (if executable is a symlink, then first 15 chars of symlink name are used)
 cmdline: argv[0] from exec syscall
 exe: points to executable (resolves symlink, unlike comm)

script (an executable with #!/path/to/interpreter):
 comm: first 15 chars of script's base name (symlinks are not resolved)
 cmdline: /path/to/interpreter (symlinks are not resolved)
 (script name is in argv[1], args are pushed into argv[2] etc)
 exe: points to interpreter's executable (symlinks are resolved)

If FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS=y (and more so if FEATURE_SH_STANDALONE=y),
some commands started from busybox shell, xargs or find are started by
execXXX("/proc/self/exe", applet_name, params....)
and therefore comm field contains "exe".
