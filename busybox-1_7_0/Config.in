config NITPICK
	bool "See lots more (probably unnecessary) configuration options."
	default n
	help
	  Some BusyBox applets have more configuration options than anyone
	  will ever care about.  To avoid drowining people in complexity, most
	  of the applet features that can be set to a sane default value are
	  hidden, unless you hit the above switch.

	  This is better than to telling people to edit the busybox source
	  code, but not by much.

	  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly#The_Closet

	  You have been warned.

config DESKTOP
	bool "Enable options for full-blown desktop systems"
	default n
	help
	  Enable options and features which are not essential.
	  Select this only if you plan to use busybox on full-blown
	  desktop machine with common Linux distro, not on an embedded box.

choice
	prompt "Buffer allocation policy"
	default FEATURE_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
	depends on NITPICK
	help
	  There are 3 ways BusyBox can handle buffer allocations:
	  - Use malloc. This costs code size for the call to xmalloc.
	  - Put them on stack. For some very small machines with limited stack
	    space, this can be deadly.  For most folks, this works just fine.
	  - Put them in BSS. This works beautifully for computers with a real
	    MMU (and OS support), but wastes runtime RAM for uCLinux. This
	    behavior was the only one available for BusyBox versions 0.48 and
	    earlier.

config FEATURE_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
	bool "Allocate with Malloc"

config FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK
	bool "Allocate on the Stack"

config FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_IN_BSS
	bool "Allocate in the .bss section"

config SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show terse applet usage messages"
	default y
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show help messages when invoked with
	  wrong arguments. You can turn off printing these terse usage
	  messages if you say no here.
	  This will save you up to 7k.

config FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default n
	select SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show more verbose help messages when
	  busybox is invoked with --help.  This will add a lot of text to the
	  busybox binary.  In the default configuration, this will add about
	  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.

config FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default y
	depends on SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Store usage messages in compressed form, uncompress them on-the-fly
	  when <applet> --help is called.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable.  Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win.  Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default n
	help
	  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support.  This will allow you to use
	  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	  applets that are compiled into busybox.

config LOCALE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable locale support (system needs locale for this to work)"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this if your system has locale support and you would like
	  busybox to support locale settings.

config GETOPT_LONG
	bool "Enable support for --long-options"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	  style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default y
	help
	  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side.  Otherwise, BSD style
	  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	  devpts mounted.

config FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default n
	depends on NITPICK
	help
	  As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	  freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files.  This saves
	  space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	  like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	  things up manually.

config FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default n
	help
	  This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	  a pidfile in /var/run. Some applications rely on them.

config FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Support for SUID/SGID handling"
	default n
	help
	  With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	  to root with the suid bit set, and it'll and it'll automatically drop
	  priviledges for applets that don't need root access.

	  If you're really paranoid and don't want to do this, build two
	  busybox binaries with different applets in them (and the appropriate
	  symlinks pointing to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the
	  one that needs it.  The applets currently marked to need the suid bit
	  are login, passwd, su, ping, traceroute, crontab, dnsd, ipcrm, ipcs,
	  and vlock.

config FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Runtime SUID/SGID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default n if FEATURE_SUID
	depends on FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	  by checking /etc/busybox.conf.  (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	  The format of this file is as follows:

	  <applet> = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] (<username>|<uid>).(<groupname>|<gid>)

	  An example might help:

	  [SUID]
	  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with euid=0/egid=0
	  su = ssx        # exactly the same

	  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members of group disk
	                        # and runs with euid=0

	  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	  The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	  writeable only by root:
	  	(chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	  The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	  root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
	  	(chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	  Robert 'sandman' Griebl has more information here:
	  <url: http://www.softforge.de/bb/suid.html >.

config FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG_QUIET
	bool "Suppress warning message if /etc/busybox.conf is not readable"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	help
	  /etc/busybox.conf should be readable by the user needing the SUID, check
	  this option to avoid users to be notified about missing permissions.

config SELINUX
	bool "Support NSA Security Enhanced Linux"
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id.  Also provide
	  the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	  If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	  will not compile. Go visit
		http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/index.html
	  to download the necessary stuff to allow busybox to compile with
	  this option enabled. Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	  directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	  non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:
		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default n
	help
	  This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	  call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	  searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	  /proc/self/exe.
	  This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	  They will use applets even if /bin/<applet> -> busybox link
	  is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	  problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	  (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to BusyBox executable"
	default "/proc/self/exe"
	help
	  When Busybox applets need to run other busybox applets, BusyBox
	  sometimes needs to exec() itself.  When the /proc filesystem is
	  mounted, /proc/self/exe always points to the currently running
	  executable.  If you haven't got /proc, set this to wherever you
	  want to run BusyBox from.

# These are auto-selected by other options

config FEATURE_SYSLOG
	bool "Support for logging to syslog"
	default n
	help
	  This option is auto-selected when you select any applet which may
	  send its output to syslog. You do not need to select it manually.

config FEATURE_HAVE_RPC
	bool "RPC support"
	default n
	help
	  This is automatically selected if any of enabled applets need it.
	  You do not need to select it manually.

config STATIC
	bool "Build BusyBox as a static binary (no shared libs)"
	default n
	help
	  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
	  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
	  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
	  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
	  your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
	  you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
	  BusyBox, etc).

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	bool "Build shared libbusybox"
	default n
	help
	  Build a shared library libbusybox.so which contains all
	  libraries used inside busybox.

	  This is an experimental feature intended to support the upcoming
	  "make standalone" mode.  Enabling it against the one big busybox
	  binary serves no purpose (and increases the size).  You should
	  almost certainly say "no" to this right now.

config FEATURE_FULL_LIBBUSYBOX
	bool "Feature-complete libbusybox"
	default n if !FEATURE_SHARED_BUSYBOX
	depends on BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	help
	  Build a libbusybox with the complete feature-set, disregarding
	  the actually selected config.

	  Normally, libbusybox will only contain the features which are
	  used by busybox itself. If you plan to write a separate
	  standalone application which uses libbusybox say 'Y'.

	  Note: libbusybox is GPL, not LGPL, and exports no stable API that
	  might act as a copyright barrier.  We can and will modify the
	  exported function set between releases (even minor version number
	  changes), and happily break out-of-tree features.

	  Say 'N' if in doubt.

config FEATURE_SHARED_BUSYBOX
	bool "Use shared libbusybox for busybox"
	default y if BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	depends on !STATIC && BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	help
	  Use libbusybox.so also for busybox itself.
	  You need to have a working dynamic linker to use this variant.

config LFS
	bool "Build with Large File Support (for accessing files > 2 GB)"
	default n
	select FDISK_SUPPORT_LARGE_DISKS
	help
	  If you want to build BusyBox with large file support, then enable
	  this option.  This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
	  library lacks large file support for large files.  Some of the
	  programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
	  cp, mount, tar, and many others.  If you want to access files larger
	  than 2 Gigabytes, enable this option.  Otherwise, leave it set to 'N'.

config BUILD_AT_ONCE
	bool "Compile all sources at once"
	default n
	help
	  Normally each source-file is compiled with one invocation of
	  the compiler.
	  If you set this option, all sources are compiled at once.
	  This gives the compiler more opportunities to optimize which can
	  result in smaller and/or faster binaries.

	  Setting this option will consume alot of memory, e.g. if you
	  enable all applets with all features, gcc uses more than 300MB
	  RAM during compilation of busybox.

	  This option is most likely only beneficial for newer compilers
	  such as gcc-4.1 and above.

	  Say 'N' unless you know what you are doing.

menu 'Debugging Options'

config DEBUG
	bool "Build BusyBox with extra Debugging symbols"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to examine BusyBox internals while applets are
	  running.  This increases the size of the binary considerably, and
	  should only be used when doing development.  If you are doing
	  development and want to debug BusyBox, answer Y.

	  Most people should answer N.

config WERROR
	bool "Abort compilation on any warning"
	default n
	help
	  Selecting this will add -Werror to gcc command line.

	  Most people should answer N.

# Seems to be unused
#config DEBUG_PESSIMIZE
#	bool "Disable compiler optimizations."
#	default n
#	depends on DEBUG
#	help
#	  The compiler's optimization of source code can eliminate and reorder
#	  code, resulting in an executable that's hard to understand when
#	  stepping through it with a debugger.  This switches it off, resulting
#	  in a much bigger executable that more closely matches the source
#	  code.

choice
	prompt "Additional debugging library"
	default NO_DEBUG_LIB
	help
	  Using an additional debugging library will make BusyBox become
	  considerable larger and will cause it to run more slowly.  You
	  should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector.  To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	    dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space -p log-elapsed-time \
	       -p check-fence -p check-heap -p check-lists -p check-blank \
	       -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy -p allow-free-null

	  Electric-fence support:
	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support.  Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses.  This support will make BusyBox be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.
