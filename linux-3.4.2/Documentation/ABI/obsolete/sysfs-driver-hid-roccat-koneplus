Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 0-4.
                When read, this attribute returns the number of the actual
                profile. This value is persistent, so its equivalent to the
                profile that's active when the mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, this file sets the number of the startup profile
		and the mouse activates this profile immediately.
		Please use actual_profile, it does the same thing.
