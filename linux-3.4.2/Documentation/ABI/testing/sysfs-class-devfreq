Contact:	MyungJoo Ham <myungjoo.ham@samsung.com>
Description:
		The /sys/class/devfreq/.../polling_interval shows and sets
		the requested polling interval of the corresponding devfreq
		object. The values are represented in ms. If the value is
		less than 1 jiffy, it is considered to be 0, which means
		no polling. This value is meaningless if the governor is
		not polling; thus. If the governor is not using
		devfreq-provided central polling
		(/sys/class/devfreq/.../central_polling is 0), this value
		may be useless.
