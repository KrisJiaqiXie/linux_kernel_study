* ARM PrimeCell PL330 DMA Controller

The ARM PrimeCell PL330 DMA controller can move blocks of memory contents
between memory and peripherals or memory to memory.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should include both "arm,pl330" and "arm,primecell".
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.

Example:

	pdma0: pdma@12680000 {
		compatible = "arm,pl330", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x12680000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <99>;
	};

Client drivers (device nodes requiring dma transfers from dev-to-mem or
mem-to-dev) should specify the DMA channel numbers using a two-value pair
as shown below.

  [property name]  = <[phandle of the dma controller] [dma request id]>;

      where 'dma request id' is the dma request number which is connected
      to the client controller. The 'property name' is recommended to be
      of the form <name>-dma-channel.

  Example:  tx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 12>;
