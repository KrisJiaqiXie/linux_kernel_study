* I2C

Required properties :

 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible : should be "mrvl,mmp-twsi" where CHIP is the name of a
   compatible processor, e.g. pxa168, pxa910, mmp2, mmp3.
   For the pxa2xx/pxa3xx, an additional node "mrvl,pxa-i2c" is required
   as shown in the example below.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
   field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
   information for the interrupt.  This should be encoded based on
   the information in section 2) depending on the type of interrupt
   controller you have.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.
 - mrvl,i2c-polling : Disable interrupt of i2c controller. Polling
   status register of i2c controller instead.
 - mrvl,i2c-fast-mode : Enable fast mode of i2c controller.

Examples:
	twsi1: i2c@d4011000 {
		compatible = "mrvl,mmp-twsi", "mrvl,pxa-i2c";
		reg = <0xd4011000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <7>;
		mrvl,i2c-fast-mode;
	};
	
	twsi2: i2c@d4025000 {
		compatible = "mrvl,mmp-twsi", "mrvl,pxa-i2c";
		reg = <0xd4025000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <58>;
	};
