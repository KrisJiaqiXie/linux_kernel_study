* TI Highspeed MMC host controller for OMAP

The Highspeed MMC Host Controller on TI OMAP family
provides an interface for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 Should be "ti,omap2-hsmmc", for OMAP2 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap3-hsmmc", for OMAP3 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap4-hsmmc", for OMAP4 controllers
- ti,hwmods: Must be "mmc<n>", n is controller instance starting 1
- reg : should contain hsmmc registers location and length

Optional properties:
ti,dual-volt: boolean, supports dual voltage cards
<supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
"supply-name" examples are "vmmc", "vmmc_aux" etc
ti,bus-width: Number of data lines, default assumed is 1 if the property is missing.
cd-gpios: GPIOs for card detection
wp-gpios: GPIOs for write protection
ti,non-removable: non-removable slot (like eMMC)
ti,needs-special-reset: Requires a special softreset sequence

Example:
	mmc1: mmc@0x4809c000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-hsmmc";
		reg = <0x4809c000 0x400>;
		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		ti,dual-volt;
		ti,bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
	};
