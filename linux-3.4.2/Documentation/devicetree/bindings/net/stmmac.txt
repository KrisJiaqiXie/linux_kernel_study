* STMicroelectronics 10/100/1000 Ethernet driver (GMAC)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,spear600-gmac"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq"
  "eth_wake_irq" if this interrupt is supported in the "interrupts"
  property
- phy-mode: String, operation mode of the PHY interface.
  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii".

Optional properties:
- mac-address: 6 bytes, mac address

Examples:

	gmac0: ethernet@e0800000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-gmac";
		reg = <0xe0800000 0x8000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <24 23>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
		mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
		phy-mode = "gmii";
	};
