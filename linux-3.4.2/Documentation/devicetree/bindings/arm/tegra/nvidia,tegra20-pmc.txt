NVIDIA Tegra Power Management Controller (PMC)

Properties:
- name : Should be pmc
- compatible : Should contain "nvidia,tegra<chip>-pmc".
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- nvidia,invert-interrupt : If present, inverts the PMU interrupt signal.
  The PMU is an external Power Management Unit, whose interrupt output
  signal is fed into the PMC. This signal is optionally inverted, and then
  fed into the ARM GIC. The PMC is not involved in the detection or
  handling of this interrupt signal, merely its inversion.

Example:

pmc@7000f400 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-pmc";
	reg = <0x7000e400 0x400>;
	nvidia,invert-interrupt;
};
