Atmel SOC USB controllers

OHCI

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "atmel,at91rm9200-ohci" for USB controllers
   used in host mode.
 - num-ports: Number of ports.
 - atmel,vbus-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be
   activated for the bus to be powered.
 - atmel,oc-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be
   activated for the overcurrent detection.

usb0: ohci@00500000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-ohci", "usb-ohci";
	reg = <0x00500000 0x100000>;
	interrupts = <20 4>;
	num-ports = <2>;
};

EHCI

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "atmel,at91sam9g45-ehci" for USB controllers
   used in host mode.

usb1: ehci@00800000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-ehci", "usb-ehci";
	reg = <0x00800000 0x100000>;
	interrupts = <22 4>;
};

AT91 USB device controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "atmel,at91rm9200-udc"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Should contain macb interrupt

Optional properties:
 - atmel,vbus-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be
   activated for the bus to be powered.
