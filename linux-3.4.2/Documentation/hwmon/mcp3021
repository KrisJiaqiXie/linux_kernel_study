Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Microchip Technology MCP3021 chip.

The Microchip Technology Inc. MCP3021 is a successive approximation A/D
converter (ADC) with 10-bit resolution.
This device provides one single-ended input with very low power consumption.
Communication to the MCP3021 is performed using a 2-wire I2C compatible
interface. Standard (100 kHz) and Fast (400 kHz) I2C modes are available.
The default I2C device address is 0x4d (contact the Microchip factory for
additional address options).
