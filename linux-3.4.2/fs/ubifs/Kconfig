	  UBIFS is a file system for flash devices which works on top of UBI.

config UBIFS_FS_XATTR
	bool "Extended attributes support"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	help
	  This option enables support of extended attributes.

config UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	bool "Advanced compression options"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	help
	  This option allows to explicitly choose which compressions, if any,
	  are enabled in UBIFS. Removing compressors means inability to read
	  existing file systems.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config UBIFS_FS_LZO
	bool "LZO compression support" if UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	default y
	help
	   LZO compressor is generally faster than zlib but compresses worse.
	   Say 'Y' if unsure.

config UBIFS_FS_ZLIB
	bool "ZLIB compression support" if UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Zlib compresses better than LZO but it is slower. Say 'Y' if unsure.

# Debugging-related stuff
config UBIFS_FS_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debugging support"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	select DEBUG_FS
	select KALLSYMS
	help
	  This option enables UBIFS debugging support. It makes sure various
	  assertions, self-checks, debugging messages and test modes are compiled
	  in (this all is compiled out otherwise). Assertions are light-weight
	  and this option also enables them. Self-checks, debugging messages and
	  test modes are switched off by default. Thus, it is safe and actually
	  recommended to have debugging support enabled, and it should not slow
	  down UBIFS. You can then further enable / disable individual  debugging
	  features using UBIFS module parameters and the corresponding sysfs
	  interfaces.
