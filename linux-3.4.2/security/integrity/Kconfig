	help
	  This option enables digital signature verification support
	  using multiple keyrings. It defines separate keyrings for each
	  of the different use cases - evm, ima, and modules.
	  Different keyrings improves search performance, but also allow
	  to "lock" certain keyring to prevent adding new keys.
	  This is useful for evm and module keyrings, when keys are
	  usually only added from initramfs.
