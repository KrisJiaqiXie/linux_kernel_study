	bool "Fujitsu devices"
	default y
	depends on ISA || PCMCIA || ((ISA || MCA_LEGACY) && EXPERIMENTAL)
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  the questions about Fujitsu cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_FUJITSU

config AT1700
	tristate "AT1700/1720 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on (ISA || MCA_LEGACY) && EXPERIMENTAL
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called at1700.

	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a Fujitsu FMV-J18x or compatible
	  PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called fmvj18x_cs.  If unsure, say N.

config ETH16I
	tristate "ICL EtherTeam 16i/32 support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called eth16i.
