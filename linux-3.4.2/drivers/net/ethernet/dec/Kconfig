config NET_VENDOR_DEC
	bool "Digital Equipment devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || EISA || CARDBUS
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about DEC cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_DEC

config EWRK3
	tristate "EtherWORKS 3 (DE203, DE204, DE205) support"
	depends on ISA
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This driver supports the DE203, DE204 and DE205 network (Ethernet)
	  cards. If this is for you, say Y and read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/ewrk3.txt> in the kernel source as
	  well as the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called ewrk3.
