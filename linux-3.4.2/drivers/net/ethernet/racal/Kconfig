# Racal-Interlan device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_RACAL
	bool "Racal-Interlan (Micom) NI devices"
	default y
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, such
	  as the NI5010, NI5210 or NI6210, say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about NI cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_RACAL

config NI5010
	tristate "NI5010 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ISA && EXPERIMENTAL && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Note that this is still
	  experimental code.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called ni5010.
