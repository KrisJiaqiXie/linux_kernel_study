	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c523.

config ELMC_II

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c527.

config ARM_ETHER1
	tristate "Acorn Ether1 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	---help---
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these (AKA25) network cards,
	  you should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config APRICOT
	tristate "Apricot Xen-II on board Ethernet"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) controller of this type, say Y and
	  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module

config BVME6000_NET
	tristate "BVME6000 Ethernet support"
	depends on BVME6000
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the Ethernet interface on BVME4000 and
	  BVME6000 VME boards.  Say Y here to include the driver for this chip
	  in your kernel.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config EEXPRESS
	tristate "EtherExpress 16 support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have an EtherExpress16 network (Ethernet) card, say Y and
	  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the Intel
	  EtherExpress16 card used to be regarded as a very poor choice
	  because the driver was very unreliable. We now have a new driver
	  that should do better.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called eexpress.

config EEXPRESS_PRO
	tristate "EtherExpressPro support/EtherExpress 10 (i82595) support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y. This
	  driver supports Intel i82595{FX,TX} based boards. Note however
	  that the EtherExpress PRO/100 Ethernet card has its own separate
	  driver.  Please read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called eepro.

config LASI_82596

	  found in Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC machines with 10Mbit ethernet.

config LP486E
	tristate "LP486E on board Ethernet"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support the 82596-based on-board Ethernet controller
	  for the Panther motherboard, which is one of the two shipped in the
	  Intel Professional Workstation.

config MVME16x_NET
	tristate "MVME16x Ethernet support"
	depends on MVME16x

	  This is the driver for the Ethernet interface on the Motorola
	  MVME162, 166, 167, 172 and 177 boards.  Say Y here to include the
	  driver for this chip in your kernel.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config NI52
	tristate "NI5210 support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called ni52.

config SNI_82596

	depends on SUN3
	---help---
	  This driver enables support for the on-board Intel 82586 based
	  Ethernet adapter found on Sun 3/1xx and 3/2xx motherboards.  Note
	  that this driver does not support 82586-based adapters on additional
	  VME boards.

config ZNET
	tristate "Zenith Z-Note support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && ISA_DMA_API
	---help---
	  The Zenith Z-Note notebook computer has a built-in network
	  (Ethernet) card, and this is the Linux driver for it. Note that the
	  IBM Thinkpad 300 is compatible with the Z-Note and is also supported
	  by this driver. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
