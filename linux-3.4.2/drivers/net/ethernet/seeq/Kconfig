config NET_VENDOR_SEEQ
	bool "SEEQ devices"
	default y
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on (ARM && ARCH_ACORN) || SGI_HAS_SEEQ || EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about SEEQ devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_SEEQ

config ARM_ETHER3
	tristate "Acorn/ANT Ether3 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	---help---
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config SEEQ8005
	tristate "SEEQ8005 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the SEEQ 8005 network (Ethernet) card.  If this
	  is for you, read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called seeq8005.

config SGISEEQ
	tristate "SGI Seeq ethernet controller support"
	depends on SGI_HAS_SEEQ
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an Seeq based Ethernet network card. This is
	  used in many Silicon Graphics machines.
