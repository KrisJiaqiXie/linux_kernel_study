	---help---
	  The common clock framework is a single definition of struct
	  clk, useful across many platforms, as well as an
	  implementation of the clock API in include/linux/clk.h.
	  Architectures utilizing the common struct clk should select
	  this option.

config COMMON_CLK_DISABLE_UNUSED
	bool "Disabled unused clocks at boot"
	depends on COMMON_CLK
	---help---
	  Traverses the entire clock tree and disables any clocks that are
	  enabled in hardware but have not been enabled by any device drivers.
	  This saves power and keeps the software model of the clock in line
	  with reality.

	  If in doubt, say "N".

config COMMON_CLK_DEBUG
	bool "DebugFS representation of clock tree"
	depends on COMMON_CLK
	select DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  Creates a directory hierchy in debugfs for visualizing the clk
	  tree structure.  Each directory contains read-only members
	  that export information specific to that clk node: clk_rate,
	  clk_flags, clk_prepare_count, clk_enable_count &
	  clk_notifier_count.
