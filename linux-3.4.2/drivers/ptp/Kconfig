	depends on PPS
	help
	  The IEEE 1588 standard defines a method to precisely
	  synchronize distributed clocks over Ethernet networks. The
	  standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can
	  be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen
	  microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware
	  time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve
	  synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.

	  This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character
	  devices. If you want to use a PTP clock, then you should
	  also enable at least one clock driver as well.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_GIANFAR
	tristate "Freescale eTSEC as PTP clock"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	depends on GIANFAR
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the eTSEC as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called gianfar_ptp.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_IXP46X
	tristate "Intel IXP46x as PTP clock"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	depends on IXP4XX_ETH
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the IXP46X as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_ixp46x.

comment "Enable PHYLIB and NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING to see the additional clocks."

config DP83640_PHY
	tristate "Driver for the National Semiconductor DP83640 PHYTER"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	depends on NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
	depends on PHYLIB
	---help---
	  Supports the DP83640 PHYTER with IEEE 1588 features.

	  This driver adds support for using the DP83640 as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  In order for this to work, your MAC driver must also
	  implement the skb_tx_timetamp() function.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_PCH
	tristate "Intel PCH EG20T as PTP clock"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	depends on PCH_GBE
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the PCH EG20T as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_pch.
