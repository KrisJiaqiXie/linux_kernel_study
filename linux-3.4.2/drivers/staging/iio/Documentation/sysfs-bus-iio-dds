What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_freqY
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Stores frequency into tuning word Y.
		There will be more than one ddsX_freqY file, which allows for
		pin controlled FSK Frequency Shift Keying
		(ddsX_pincontrol_freq_en is active) or the user can control
		the desired active tuning word by writing Y to the
		ddsX_freqsymbol file.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_freqY_scale
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Scale to be applied to ddsX_freqY in order to obtain the
		desired value in Hz. If shared across all frequency registers
		Y is not present. It is also possible X is not present if
		shared across all channels.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_freqsymbol
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the active output frequency tuning word. The value
		corresponds to the Y in ddsX_freqY. To exit this mode the user
		can write ddsX_pincontrol_freq_en or ddsX_out_enable file.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_phaseY
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Stores phase into Y.
		There will be more than one ddsX_phaseY file, which allows for
		pin controlled PSK Phase Shift Keying
		(ddsX_pincontrol_phase_en is active) or the user can
		control the desired phase Y which is added to the phase
		accumulator output by writing Y to the en_phase file.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_phaseY_scale
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Scale to be applied to ddsX_phaseY in order to obtain the
		desired value in rad. If shared across all phase registers
		Y is not present. It is also possible X is not present if
		shared across all channels.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_phasesymbol
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the active phase Y which is added to the phase
		accumulator output. The value corresponds to the Y in
		ddsX_phaseY. To exit this mode the user can write
		ddsX_pincontrol_phase_en or disable file.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_pincontrol_en
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_pincontrol_freq_en
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_pincontrol_phase_en
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		ddsX_pincontrol_en: Both, the active frequency and phase is
		controlled by the respective phase and frequency control inputs.
		In case the device in question allows to independent controls,
		then there are dedicated files (ddsX_pincontrol_freq_en,
		ddsX_pincontrol_phase_en).

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_out_enable
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_outY_enable
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		ddsX_outY_enable controls signal generation on output Y of
		channel X. Y may be suppressed if all channels are
		controlled together.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_outY_wavetype
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the output waveform.
		(sine, triangle, ramp, square, ...)
		For a list of available output waveform options read
		available_output_modes.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/.../ddsX_outY_wavetype_available
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Lists all available output waveform options.
