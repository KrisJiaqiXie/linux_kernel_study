This is a driver for the ET1310 network device.

Based on the driver found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/et131x/

Cleaned up immensely by Olaf Hartman and Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>

Note, the powermanagement options were removed from the vendor provided
driver as they did not build properly at the time.

TODO:
	- Use of kmem_cache seems a bit unusual

Please send patches to:
