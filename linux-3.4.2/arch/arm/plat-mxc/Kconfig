config MXC_IRQ_PRIOR
	bool "Use IRQ priority"
	help
	  Select this if you want to use prioritized IRQ handling.
	  This feature prevents higher priority ISR to be interrupted
	  by lower priority IRQ even IRQF_DISABLED flag is not set.
	  This may be useful in embedded applications, where are strong
	  requirements for timing.
	  Say N here, unless you have a specialized requirement.

config MXC_DEBUG_BOARD
	bool "Enable MXC debug board(for 3-stack)"
	help
	  The debug board is an integral part of the MXC 3-stack(PDK)
	  platforms, it can be attached or removed from the peripheral
	  board. On debug board, several debug devices(ethernet, UART,
	  buttons, LEDs and JTAG) are implemented. Between the MCU and
	  these devices, a CPLD is added as a bridge which performs
	  data/address de-multiplexing and decode, signal level shift,
	  interrupt control and various board functions.

config HAVE_EPIT
	bool

config MXC_USE_EPIT
	bool "Use EPIT instead of GPT"
	depends on HAVE_EPIT
	help
	  Use EPIT as the system timer on systems that have it. Normally you
	  don't have a reason to do so as the EPIT has the same features and
	  uses the same clocks as the GPT. Anyway, on some systems the GPT
	  may be in use for other purposes.
