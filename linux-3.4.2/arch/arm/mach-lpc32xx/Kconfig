	bool "Use IRAM for network buffers"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to use the LPC internal fast IRAM (i.e. 256KB SRAM) as
	  network buffer.  If the total combined required buffer sizes is
	  larger than the size of IRAM, then SDRAM will be used instead.

	  This can be enabled safely if the IRAM is not intended for other
	  uses.

config ARCH_LPC32XX_MII_SUPPORT
	bool "Check to enable MII support or leave disabled for RMII support"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable MII support, or N for RMII support. Regardless of
	  which support is selected, the ethernet interface driver needs to be
	  selected in the device driver networking section.

	  The PHY3250 reference board uses RMII, so users of this board should
	  say N.
