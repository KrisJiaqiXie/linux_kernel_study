menuconfig VIRTUALIZATION
	bool "Virtualization"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run
	  other operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	  disabled.

	bool "KVM support for POWER7 and PPC970 using hypervisor mode in host"

	select MMU_NOTIFIER
	---help---
	  Support running unmodified book3s_64 guest kernels in
	  virtual machines on POWER7 and PPC970 processors that have
	  hypervisor mode available to the host.

	  If you say Y here, KVM will use the hardware virtualization
	  facilities of POWER7 (and later) processors, meaning that
	  guest operating systems will run at full hardware speed
	  using supervisor and user modes.  However, this also means
	  that KVM is not usable under PowerVM (pHyp), is only usable
	  on POWER7 (or later) processors and PPC970-family processors,
	  and cannot emulate a different processor from the host processor.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Support running unmodified 440 guest kernels in virtual machines on
	  440 host processors.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_EXIT_TIMING

	---help---
	  Calculate elapsed time for every exit/enter cycle. A per-vcpu
	  report is available in debugfs kvm/vm#_vcpu#_timing.
	  The overhead is relatively small, however it is not recommended for
	  production environments.
