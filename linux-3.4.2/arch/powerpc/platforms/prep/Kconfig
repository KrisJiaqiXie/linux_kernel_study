	  Some PReP systems have residual data passed to the kernel by the
	  firmware.  This allows detection of memory size, devices present and
	  other useful pieces of information.  Sometimes this information is
	  not present or incorrect, in which case it could lead to the machine 
	  behaving incorrectly.  If this happens, either disable PREP_RESIDUAL
	  or pass the 'noresidual' option to the kernel.

	  If you are running a PReP system, say Y here, otherwise say N.
