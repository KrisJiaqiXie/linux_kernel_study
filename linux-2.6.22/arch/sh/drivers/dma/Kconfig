config SH_DMA
	bool "SuperH on-chip DMA controller (DMAC) support"
	select SH_DMA_API

config NR_ONCHIP_DMA_CHANNELS
	depends on SH_DMA
	int "Number of on-chip DMAC channels"
	default "8" if CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7750R || CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7751R
	default "12" if CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7780
	default "4"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the number of channels that the on-chip
	  DMAC supports. This will be 4 for SH7750/SH7751 and 8 for the
	  SH7750R/SH7751R.

config NR_DMA_CHANNELS_BOOL
	depends on SH_DMA
	bool "Override default number of maximum DMA channels"
	help
	  This allows you to forcibly update the maximum number of supported
	  DMA channels for a given board. If this is unset, this will default
	  to the number of channels that the on-chip DMAC has.

config NR_DMA_CHANNELS
	int "Maximum number of DMA channels"
	depends on SH_DMA && NR_DMA_CHANNELS_BOOL
	default NR_ONCHIP_DMA_CHANNELS
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of DMA channels to
	  support. Setting this to a higher value allows for cascading DMACs
	  with additional channels.

config DMA_PAGE_OPS
	bool "Use DMAC for page copy/clear"
	depends on SH_DMA && BROKEN
	help
	  Selecting this option will use a dual-address mode configured channel
	  in the SH DMAC for copy_page()/clear_page(). Primarily a performance
	  hack.

config DMA_PAGE_OPS_CHANNEL
	depends on DMA_PAGE_OPS
	int "DMA channel for sh memory-manager page copy/clear"
	default "3"
	help
	  This allows the specification of the dual address dma channel,
	  in case channel 3 is unavailable. On the SH4, channels 1,2, and 3
	  are dual-address capable.

config SH_DMABRG
	bool "SH7760 DMABRG support"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7760
	help
	  The DMABRG does data transfers from main memory to Audio/USB units
	  of the SH7760.
	  Say Y if you want to use Audio/USB DMA on your SH7760 board.
